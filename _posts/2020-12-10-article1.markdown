United Vendors is a coalition group that advocates for the decriminalization of street vending policies in the Washington D.C. area. It is supported by a non-profit organization, MLOV. Along with the organization, the group receives help from a group of young legal professionals from the Washington College of Law. They are Eric & Liriam.
