Ward 1 Council Member Brianne Nadeau has introduced legislation aimed at formalizing the sidewalk vending economy and establishing designated zones for vendors. The legislation would amend the Vending Regulations Act of 2009 to create designated zones where sidewalk vendors can legally operate. It would also establish two new licenses: The first would be for a single sidewalk vendor, while the second is geared toward organizations and cooperatives vendors can register with to access the sidewalk vending zones.
